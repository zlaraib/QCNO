    "This script generates quantum circuit for a one-body time-evolution operator under a Hamiltonian $$ H = \\sum_{i=0}^{N} \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma_i} , $$  where the normalized vector given by $ \\vec{b}= \\frac{\\delta m^2}{4E} * (sin(2\\theta_\\nu), 0 , -cos(2\\theta_\\nu)) $ with $\\theta_\\nu $ as the mixing angle, $\\delta m^2$ as the mass difference squared, E as the energies of the neutrino beam, and $ \\vec{\\sigma_i} $ are the Pauli matrices for the i-th qubit.

If we decompose $ \\vec{b} $ into its Cartesian components $\\vec{b} = (b_x, b_y, b_z) $, this translates to rotations around the x, y, and z axes by angles proportional to $ b_x dt $,  $b_y dt $, and $ b_z dt $ respectively.\n",
